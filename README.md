# Compression Algorithms
Some compression algorithms involves *lossless* and *lossy* techniques.

## The algorithms
```
1. LZ77 algorithm [lossless - text]
2. LZW algorithm [lossless - text]
3. Arithmatic coding algorithm [lossless - text]
4. Reuglar huffman algorithm [lossless - text]
5. Non-uniform scalar quantizar algorithm [lossy - text/image]
6. Vector quantization algorithm [lossy - image]
7. Predictive coding algorithm [lossy - image]
```
